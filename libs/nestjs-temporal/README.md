# nestjs-temporal
This library is basically stolen from [nestjs-temporal](https://github.com/KurtzL/nestjs-temporal) it was abandoned and left at version 0.18.0 of the temporal library
The goal is to update this to modern temporal and to add any features that we need to make it work with our workflows.
